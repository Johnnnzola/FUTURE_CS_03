PASSWORD ANALYSER

Overview
The Password Analyzer is a tool designed to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords. It analyzes a given password to check for common weaknesses, including length, complexity, use of common patterns, and resistance to brute-force attacks. The analyzer provides feedback and suggestions on how to improve password security.

This tool can be used by developers, security professionals, or any user who wants to ensure their password is strong enough to withstand unauthorized access attempts.

Features
Strength Evaluation: Analyzes password strength based on length, character variety (upper, lower, digits, symbols), and entropy.
Common Password Check: Compares the password against a list of commonly used passwords and checks if it's weak.
Pattern Detection: Detects common patterns, such as repeated characters or sequences (e.g., "12345" or "password").
Entropy Calculation: Measures the randomness of the password and estimates how long it might take a computer to crack it using brute-force methods.
Suggestions for Improvement: Based on the analysis, the tool offers actionable suggestions to help make the password more secure.


Installation
Clone the repository:
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

Usage
Command Line: Once the script is running, you can enter a password when prompted. The tool will display a detailed evaluation of the password's strength, pointing out any weaknesses, and offering suggestions for improvement.

API Usage: You can also integrate the Password Analyzer into your application by calling the functions provided in the password_analyzer.py file. For example:
from password_analyzer import analyze_password
password = "your_password_here"
result = analyze_password(password)
print(result)
The result will include an evaluation of the password and a list of recommendations.

How It Works
The Password Analyzer uses several key metrics to assess password strength:

Length: Longer passwords are more secure.
Character Variety: A mix of upper case, lower case, numbers, and symbols strengthens a password.
Entropy: The randomness of the password, calculated using a statistical model, gives an estimate of how difficult the password is to guess or brute-force.
Dictionary Check: Compares the password against a database of commonly used passwords to ensure it's not easily guessable.
Pattern Detection: Recognizes common patterns, such as sequences of numbers or letters, which make a password easier to crack.

Analysis:
- Length: 11 characters
- Complexity: Medium (lowercase, uppercase, digits)
- Common Password Check: Weak (found in common password database)
- Entropy: 36.4 bits (Medium strength)

Suggestions:
1. Use a longer password (16+ characters recommended).
2. Avoid using common passwords or easily guessable phrases.
3. Add special characters for more complexity (e.g., "!@#$%^").
